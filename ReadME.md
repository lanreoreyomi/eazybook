## Introduction

Eazybook provides a platform for users to access a wide range of books online. Users can browse the catalogue, add books to their wishlist, and rent books for a two-week period. The application is built using a microservices architecture, leveraging Spring Boot for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

## Architecture

Eazybook follows an MVC microservices architecture, consisting of four distinct services: Authentication, Book Catalogue, Wishlist, and User. These services communicate with each other to provide a seamless user experience. The frontend, built with Vue.js, interacts with these microservices.

Each microservice has a controller, service, and database layer.

- **Access:** [http://eazybookapp.com/#/](http://eazybookapp.com/#/)


## Database

- **Deployment:** PostgreSQL running in a Docker container on the same droplet, exposed internally on port `5432`.

## Service Discovery

- **Technology:** [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) is used for service discovery between microservices.
- **Deployment:** Runs in a Docker container on the droplet.


## Deployment

### DigitalOcean Droplet Deployment

The entire application stack is deployed on a single DigitalOcean droplet using Docker containers.

- **Dockerized Services:**
  - Each microservice runs in its own container.
  - A dedicated PostgreSQL container handles data persistence.
  - Consul handles service registration and discovery.
  - The Vue frontend is containerized and served via Nginx.

- **Nginx:**
  - Acts as a reverse proxy.
  - Proxies requests to each microservice using container names (via internal Docker DNS).
  - Serves the frontend static files built by Vue.

- **Docker Networking:**
  - All containers are connected to the same Docker Compose network (`eazybooks_default`), allowing them to communicate via service names.

- **Access:** Application is exposed on port 80 of the dropletâ€™s public IP address.

Before running `docker-compose up` for the first time, or if you want to ensure you have the latest versions of the images defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, you can explicitly pull them. While `docker-compose up` will automatically pull images if they are not found locally, you can also do it manually:

To pull the PostgreSQL image (the `docker-compose.yaml` uses the official 'postgres' image, typically meaning latest stable):
```bash
docker pull postgres
```

To pull the Consul image (version `1.15.3` as specified in `docker-compose.yaml`):
```bash
docker pull consul:1.15.3
```

### Running the Application

There are two primary ways to run the application locally:

1.  **Using Docker Compose (Production-like Setup):**
  *   This method runs all services (backend microservices, Postgres, Consul, Nginx, and frontend) in Docker containers, simulating a production environment.
  *   Open a terminal in the project root directory and run the command:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
      ```
  *   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

2.  **Running Backend and Frontend Separately (Development Setup):**
   *   This method allows for more granular control and faster development iterations for individual services.
     *   **Prerequisites:** Ensure Postgres and Consul are running. You can start them using Docker Compose:
         ```bash
         docker-compose up -d postgres consul
         ```
       ```bash
       docker run -d -p 8500:8500 consul:1.15.3
       ``` 

  *   **Backend (Spring Boot Microservices):**
    *   Each microservice (Authentication, Book Catalogue, User, Wishlist) needs to be run separately.
    *   Navigate to the root directory of each microservice (e.g., `cd authentication`).
    *   Run the service using Maven:
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    *   Repeat this for all backend microservices.
  *   **Frontend (Vue.js):**
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Run the development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. Check the terminal output for the exact URL.

### Database Configuration

The application uses PostgreSQL as its database. When running the application using `docker-compose up`, a PostgreSQL container is automatically started and configured.

Here are the connection details:

*   **Database Name:** `eazybooks`
*   **Username:** `eazybook_dbuser`
*   **Password:** `eazybook_dbpassword`
*   **Host:**
  *   `postgres`: When backend services are running as Docker containers (e.g., via `docker-compose up` or if you run a backend service container manually and connect it to the `eazybooks_default` network).
  *   `localhost`: When running backend services directly on your host machine (e.g., via `mvn spring-boot:run`) and connecting to the PostgreSQL container started by `docker-compose`.
*   **Port:** `5432` (This port is mapped to the host, so it's accessible whether connecting from another container on the same Docker network or from the host machine).

These details are defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file and are used by the backend microservices to connect to the database.

### Service Discovery (Consul)

Eazybook uses HashiCorp Consul for service discovery, allowing microservices to find and communicate with each other.

*   **How it works:** When backend microservices start, they register themselves with Consul. Other services can then query Consul to discover the network locations (IP address and port) of these registered services.
*   **Local Setup:**
  *   When running the application using `docker-compose up`, a Consul container is automatically started.
  *   If you are running services individually (e.g., for development), you can start Consul along with PostgreSQL using:
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d postgres consul
      ```
*   **Consul UI:** You can access the Consul UI in your web browser at `http://localhost:8500`. This interface allows you to see which services are registered and their status.

When running backend services locally (e.g., via `mvn spring-boot:run`), they will automatically try to register with the Consul instance running at `http://localhost:8500`.
